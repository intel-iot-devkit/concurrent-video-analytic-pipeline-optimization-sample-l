# Testing

## Requirements

Hardware Requirements: Coffee Lake or Whiskey Lake
Software Requirements: Ubuntu 18.04, MediaSDK 19.4.0 and OpenVINO 2019 R3 

## How to test your changes

### 1. Build the sample applicaton

```sh
./build_and_install.sh
```
Apply the changes to MediaSDK/samples/video_e2e_sample/. Then build video_e2e_sample:
```sh
cp msdk_build.sh MediaSDK
cd MediaSDK
./msdk_build.sh
```

### 2. Run tests to make sure below tests can run without error 

Simple display test:
```sh
./bin/video_e2e_sample -par par_file/par_file_name.par
```
Basic video decoding and inference tests:
n16_1080p_1080p_dp_noinfer.par
n16_1080p_1080p_dp.par
n16_1080p_4k_dp.par
n4_1080p_1080p_dp.par
n4_vehical_detect_1080p.par
n64_d1_1080p_dp.par

RTSP play and saving tests:
rtsp_dump_only.par
n16_1080p_rtsp_simu.pa
n4_1080p_rtsp_simu_dp.par
n16_1080p_rtsp_simu_dump.par

Multiple display test:
```sh
./bin/video_e2e_sample -par par_file/n16_1080p_1080p_dp_noinfer.par -par par_file/n16_1080p_1080p_dp.par
```
